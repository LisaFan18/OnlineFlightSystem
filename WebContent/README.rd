In this project, you will design and implement a relational database system to support the operations of an online travel reservation system. You will use HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server.
You will have to install your own virtual machine with a web server that will host your web
application as well as a MySQL server. Everything will be under the AWS (Amazon Web Services).
