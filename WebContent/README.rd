In this project, we designed and implemented a relational database system to support the operations of an online flight reservation system. We used HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server.
We installed a Tomcat web server that hosted our web application. MySQL server was under the AWS-RDS (Amazon Web Services).
